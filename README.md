# üéµ Nirmalify Music Player: Final Project Documentation

## üöÄ Project Overview

**Nirmalify Music Player** is a modern, responsive web application designed to simulate a premium music streaming platform with a strong focus on **Indian regional music** (Hindi, English, Tamil, Telugu) and a superior **User Experience (UX/UI)**.

This project was built from an initial template and completely transformed to represent a unique, brand-focused application, demonstrating proficiency in structural integrity (HTML), aesthetic design (CSS/SASS), and dynamic interactivity (JavaScript).

## ‚ú® Key Features & UX/UI Highlights

* **Dynamic Music Hubs:** The platform is segmented into four primary regional hubs: **Hindi, English, Tamil, and Telugu**.
* **Single-Page Playlist Logic:** On dedicated hub pages (e.g., `hindi.html`), clicking any artist card dynamically loads their 100-song **Spotify Playlist** onto the same page using JavaScript, avoiding unnecessary page reloads and enhancing speed.
* **Responsive Design:** The entire website is fully responsive, ensuring optimal display and usability across all device sizes (Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop).
* **Scroll Reveal Animation:** Key content sections on the homepage (Music, About, Founder) use **JavaScript's IntersectionObserver** combined with CSS to smoothly slide in and fade up as the user scrolls, creating a modern, dynamic browsing experience.
* **Brand Focused Content:** All generic and outdated content (like "myTunes" and "Orange Store") has been replaced with engaging descriptions centered around Nirmalify's mission to deliver diverse music and high-quality audio.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack & Structure

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure with modular design (`index.html`, `music.html`, `hindi.html`, etc.).
* **CSS3:** Custom properties (CSS Variables), Flexbox, and extensive **Media Queries** for full responsiveness.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** Used primarily for the **Scroll Reveal** animation and the **Dynamic Playlist Loader** functionality across the regional hubs.
* **External Integration:** Music playback is handled by embedding official **Spotify** playlists via `iframe` elements.
